- 👋 Hi, I’m @icamacho1
- 👀 I’m Software engineer by trade who loves cooking a weightlifting.
- I am the kind of guy who is not afraid of digging into built in modules to expand the functionality or extract key features from them to later have more minimalistic packages and not depend on updates.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning compiled languages for later implementation in cloud functions:
  1. Golang
  2. **TODO**: Rust
- 💞️ I’m currently collaborating with [pymacaron](https://github.com/pymacaron/pymacaron)
- 📫 Reach me through:
  1. [Email](mailto:iker.camacho.h@gmail.com)
